📌 Smart Agricultural Transportation System
Developed by:
Team The Cartels – Delhi Technical Campus, Greater Noida 

📖 Overview
FarmXpress is a full-stack web application designed to optimize agricultural transportation. It helps truck operators, farmers, and traders coordinate logistics efficiently by merging shipments, optimizing truck capacity, and reducing transportation costs.

💡 Problem Statement
Agricultural transportation in India faces several inefficiencies:

Low truck utilization
High empty running of trucks
Overloading issues
Lack of coordination in logistics
Our solution addresses these issues by optimizing truck capacity, minimizing empty space, and enhancing route planning.

🎯 Proposed Solution
A web-based platform where truck operators can input their routes and schedules before departure to optimize logistics.

🔹 Key Features
✅ Truck Load Merging System – Identifies overlapping routes and merges shipments.
✅ Route-Based Load Optimization – Assigns goods to trucks based on available space.
✅ Efficient Scheduling Algorithm – Analyzes schedules and generates optimized transport plans.

🚀 Uniqueness
1️⃣ Pre-Scheduled Load Merging – Unlike on-demand systems, we optimize before departure.
2️⃣ Small Operator Friendly – No dependence on large logistics firms.
3️⃣ Agriculture-Focused – Tailored for agricultural transportation inefficiencies.

🎯 Benefits
✔️ Reduces transportation costs – Optimized fuel consumption and logistics expenses.
✔️ Enhances coordination – Farmers, traders, and transporters can schedule and plan efficiently.
✔️ Better truck utilization – Reduces empty running, improving efficiency.

🔧 Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
API Testing: Postman
📌 Future Innovations
Real-Time Capacity Monitoring – ML-based model to track truck capacity dynamically.
Dynamic Route Adjustments – Intelligent route recalculations based on climatic conditions.
Automated Notifications – Notify users of available truck space in real-time.
